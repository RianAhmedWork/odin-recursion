# Simple Recursion Project

## A simple recursion project written using JavaScript

This project is a simple recursion project that uses recursion to solve the fibbonaci sequence and a simple merge sort algorithm. This project is written fully using JavaScript and it does the following:

- Can call the fibbonaci sequence both iteratively and recursively.
- Can sort an array using merge sort.
