# Simple Recursion Project

## A simple recursion project written using JavaScript

This project is a simple recursion project that uses recursion to solve the fibbonaci sequence and a simple merge sort algorithm. This project is written fully using JavaScript and it does the following:

- Can call the fibbonaci sequence both iteratively and recursively.
- Can sort an array using merge sort.

## Instructions

You need to have node installed to run the files.

- type "node fibbonaci.js" in the console to run the fibbonaci file
- type "node mergeSort.js" in the console to run the mergeSort file

If you want to you can also modify the file to add in a custom test case
